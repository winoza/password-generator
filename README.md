User clicks "Generate Password" and is given a series of prompts functioning as criteria for generating a password. User clicks "OK" or "Cancel" to choose from a combination of lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. When all the criteria has been defined, the user's generated password will appear.

### Password Requirements

* User MUST choose a number for the password length between 8 - 128.
    * Inputting a letter or symbol will not allow user to continue to the password criteria prompts.
    * Numbers less than 8 or greater than 128 will not allow user to the password criteria prompts.
